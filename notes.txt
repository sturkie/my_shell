These are the notes for project my_shell.
This notes.txt file serves as an outline for each file of the project.


========================
BASE.H
========================

base.h serves as the component. We branch command and operators off of Base objects. It contains the virtual functions add_lhs(Base*), add_rhs(Base*), isEmpty(), and execute() for its children to inherit.

add_lhs(Base*) and add_rhs(Base*) provide functionality only in future And/Or/Semicolon implementations


========================
OPERATORS
========================

Operators is used after the user input line is parsed. It converts the command input into a c string to be used in an args array. Using args, we fork and execute the command.
