These are the notes for project my_shell.
This notes.txt file serves as an outline for each file of the project.


========================
BASE.H
========================

base.h serves as the component. We branch command and operators off of Base objects. It contains the virtual functions add_lhs(Base*), add_rhs(Base*), isEmpty(), and execute() for its children to inherit.

add_lhs(Base*) and add_rhs(Base*) provide functionality only in future And/Or/Semicolon implementations


========================
OPERATORS
========================

Operators is used after the user input line is parsed. It converts the command input into a c string to be used in an args array. Using args, we fork and execute the command. Works with flags (i.e. ls -a).


========================
MAIN
========================

Main outputs '$' and seeks user input of a command. The input string is then handled in a parse() function and then the parsed output is sent to execute_command function. A new Command object is created with the parsed output and is executed appropriately. 


========================
AND
========================
And constructs a Base* lhs and Base* rhs and in its execute() will ensure the lhs->execute() and rhs->execute() return true otherwise the whole And operation returns false.


//TODO:
	- allow there to be a false result of execution if the command is not found
	- add And/Or/Semicolon support
